And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
