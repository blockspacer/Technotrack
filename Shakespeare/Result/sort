And every fair from fair sometime declines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
